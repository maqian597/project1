First Project about website

Event and Ticket Recommandation
Online website service for users(login) to search events and purchase tickets utilizing Java and AJAX technology (HTML, CSS and JavaScript)

- Used Java to build servlets with RESTful APIs to handle HTTP requests and responses, implement relational
and non-relational databases (MySQL, MongoDB) and extract data from TicketMaster API
- Implemented content-based recommend algorithm to make event recommendation based on user favorite records
- Deployed server to Amazon EC2 to handle 150 queries per second tested by Apache JMeter

What's annoying is the CSS part.
